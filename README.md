# Amazon Customer Synthetic Data Generator

A sophisticated synthetic data generation system that creates realistic Amazon customer profiles with behavioral simulation over time. This project produces detailed customer profiles with activity logs spanning multiple years, driven by parameterized behavioral models rather than fixed archetypes.

## üöÄ Features

- Generate thousands of diverse, realistic Amazon customer profiles
- Parameterized behavioral simulation across a 5-year period
- Detailed activity logs with timestamps and contextual information
- Realistic product interactions, purchases, and service usage patterns
- Minor life events that affect customer behavior over time
- Seasonal and promotional effects on shopping behavior
- Prime membership and Amazon service adoption simulation
- Device usage patterns and cross-platform behavior

## üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AmazonCustomers.git
cd AmazonCustomers

# No external dependencies required beyond Python 3.6+
# All modules use standard library components
```

## üîç Usage

```bash
# Generate the default number of profiles (25,000)
python generate_profiles.py

# Output is saved to JSON files in the current directory by default
# Each profile is saved as amazon_customer_profile_XXXXX.json
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `config.py` file contains all configurable parameters for the simulation:

### Core Settings
```python
NUM_PROFILES_TO_GENERATE = 25000  # Number of profiles to generate
SIMULATION_DURATION_YEARS = 5     # Duration of the simulation period 
OUTPUT_DIR = "."                  # Output directory for JSON files
FILENAME_PREFIX = "amazon_customer_profile_"  # Prefix for output files
```

### Behavioral Parameters
The system uses continuous behavioral parameters rather than discrete archetypes, allowing for more realistic variation:

```python
BEHAVIORAL_PARAMS_CONFIG = {
    "activity_level": {"range": (0.05, 0.95), "type": "float"},
    "review_read_propensity": {"range": (0.05, 0.95), "type": "float"},
    "deal_seeking_propensity": {"range": (0.05, 0.95), "type": "float"},
    "tech_adoption_propensity": {"range": (0.1, 0.9), "type": "float"},
    # ... and many more parameters
}
```

### Life Stage Influences
Life stages provide initial context and parameter influences:

```python
LIFE_STAGES = [
    {"name": "Student", "age_range": (18, 24), "income_bracket_indices": [0, 1, 2], 
     "interests": ["Books", "Textbooks", "Electronics"...], 
     "param_adjustments": {"deal_seeking_propensity": 0.2, ...}},
    # ... other life stages
]
```

## üîÑ Simulation Approach

### Behavioral Parameters

Rather than using fixed customer "types," this system assigns continuous behavioral parameters to each profile:

- `activity_level`: Overall frequency of Amazon interactions
- `deal_seeking_propensity`: Tendency to use deals, coupons, sales
- `brand_affinity_strength`: Likelihood to repurchase same brand vs explore
- `tech_adoption_propensity`: Tendency to use newer features/devices/services
- And many more parameters driving realistic behavior patterns

### Event Generation

1. Each profile starts with behavioral parameters, demographics, and initial state
2. The simulation advances time, calculating intervals between events based on activity level
3. Event types are probabilistically selected based on profile parameters, state, and context
4. Detailed event information is generated appropriate to the event type
5. The profile's state is updated after each event
6. Minor life events can occur, slightly altering parameters and interests over time
7. Seasonal effects influence activity levels throughout the year

## üìÑ Output Format

Each profile is saved as a separate JSON file. The standard output contains:

- Basic demographic information
- Amazon account status (Prime, services used)
- Device usage patterns
- Initial and final interests
- A detailed activity log of events
- Minor life events that occurred

## üìù Examples

A typical workflow to analyze the generated data:

```python
import json
import os
import glob

# Load generated profiles
profile_files = glob.glob("amazon_customer_profile_*.json")
profiles = []

for file_path in profile_files[:100]:  # First 100 profiles
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        profiles.append(json.load(f))

# Example: Count Prime members
prime_count = sum(1 for p in profiles if p["amazon_status"]["is_prime_member_final"])
print(f"Prime members: {prime_count}/{len(profiles)} ({prime_count/len(profiles)*100:.1f}%)")

# Example: Most common interests
all_interests = []
for p in profiles:
    all_interests.extend(p["interests_final"])
    
from collections import Counter
common_interests = Counter(all_interests).most_common(10)
print("Top 10 interests:")
for interest, count in common_interests:
    print(f"- {interest}: {count}")
```
